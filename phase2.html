        <h1>Phase 2</h1>
        <h2>Job Searching:</h2>
        <br>
        <p>
            Job searching as a freshman who might have not even taken a single CS class yet can seem very frightening. If you think that you are not fully prepared to apply, or you don't have relevant or required experiences to apply for a specific internship, don't let that stop you from applying! I remember my freshman year thinking that it was best to apply next year when I have more CS knowledge and projects under my belt… so I did not apply to any internships. 
        </p>
        <p>
            PLEASE PLEASE don’t make the same mistake as me. Instead of making assumptions of how qualified you have to be to apply for internships, make sure you do your research! Lucky, just for freshmen and sophomores, there are many many internship opportunities. These internships tend to be for those underrepresented in tech and are meant for beginners to CS. Luckily for you, I have linked here 50+ internship opportunities for freshmen/sophomores. 
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2>Preparing for internships:</h2>
        <br>
        <p>
            Most CS internships have multiple technical round interviews where you are given coding questions you have to solve within a given timeframe. The language you code in is up to you. This means that you should have working knowledge of a language of your choice. Luckily, there are a plethora of resources online from Reddit to Youtube University. 
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Here are the steps you can follow to master a language of your choice 
        </p>
        <p>
            ~ Step 1: Do your research and pick a language. Still don’t know what to pick? Python tends to be the most popular language because it is very beginner friendly.
        </p>
        <p>
            ~ Step 2: Find a free online course to teach you the language. My language of choice was Python, so I was able to take a free course on free.code.camp.org to learn the basics of Python. Most of these courses can simply be found on Youtube! You can also consult Reddit by doing a Google search with the keyword “How to learn X language for beginners Reddit”.
        </p>
        <p>
            ~ Step 3: Once you have mastered the basics, you can build simple projects by watching tutorials on Youtube. Once you get comfortable, you can start building some of your own!
