        <h2> About</h2>
        <p>
            This website was created with inspiration from a popular early 2000’s Nickelodeon TV show called Ned’s Declassified School survival guide. As a young third-grader, I would religiously watch this show in anxious anticipation of ~middle school~. At times, this show did not do much to calm me and rather instilled new fears like a smelly locker neighbor. However, under the comedic surface of the show, there were useful tips on how to make friends, prepare for picture day, and avoid bad hair days, which at the time were all super important.

            Beginning my CS journey freshman year, I was overwhelmed by all the things I had to do, the things I didn’t know how to do, and the things I didn’t know I had to do. I often found myself wishing for a simplified guide to CS. As such, I created this website to guide students who are just beginning their journey in CS. Why should you listen to me? I have made A LOT of mistakes, which also means I have grown A LOT. This guide is based on my experiences of failure, learning, and success. That being said, it is not to say that my path is the only correct method. Instead, think of this guide as a helpful reference that can provide you with a good foundation to set you up for success. Hopefully, by the end of this guide, you will walk away with useful information that will help you not only survive CS but also thrive. Good luck!
