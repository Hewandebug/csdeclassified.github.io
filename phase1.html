        <h2>Resume</h2>
        <p>As you begin college and start to think about your career plans and “what’s next?” An important first step is to create a resume. Your resume is an important tool you will use during your job search as it showcases your skills, education, and accomplishments to your potential employers. Here’s where it can get a little scary… on average, recruiters spend 6 seconds on a resume (WOW). When I first heard this statistic I was very shocked as I realized it takes me longer to write my full name than it takes for a recruiter to read a resume.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>Fear not! In this section, I will go over everything you need to make a solid resume!

        <h3>Steps to Draft a Resume</h3>
        <p>Below is a checklist of everything you need to make a resume (courtesy of CodePath). Read over it and read it again to make sure you understand everything required.

        <p>~ Step 1: Go over the resume checklist above</p>
        <br>
        <p>~ Step 2: Create a document (preferably online) where you do an information ‘throw up’ for each of the resume sections detailed above.</p>
        <br>
        <p>~ Step 3: Congrats! You have done the hard part. Next, click on the button below, which will provide you with a pdf of a resume template from CodePath. Fill this template out while referring to step 2!</p>

        <h2>Common Resume Mistakes To Avoid:</h2>

        <br>
        <h3>Not emphasizing your skills enough:</h3>
        <p>As recruiters have less than 10 seconds to review your resume, make sure to not bury your technicals skills but rather EMPHASIZE them!</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Not detailing projects enough:
        </h3>
        <p>As you write about a role or project, make sure to emphasize the following:</p>
        <p>~ What the role/project is</p>
        <p>~ How you contributed
        </p>
        <p>~ What technical skills you used (if applicable)
        </p>
        <p>~ The impact of your role</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Not adapting your resume to the job description:
        </h3>
        <p>Make sure you research the company or organization you are applying to and highlight and relevant experiences that match th</p>
        <br>
        <h3>DON’T add color, cool fonts, a picture: basically any sort of creativity:
        </h3>
        <p>The addition of any of the above is not seen as professional. Additionally, tech companies use a software called Applicant Tracking System (ATS) that scans resumes. Using color can confuse the software. You can read more on this <a href="https://www.jobscan.co/blog/8-things-you-need-to-know-about-applicant-tracking-systems/">Here</a></p>
        <br>
        <h2>Linkedin</h2>
        <p>Another important tool to be used during your job search is a website called Linkedin. You can think of it as a social media platform where you can network with professionals, furthering your career development. Linkedin can be used to display your experience, make connections, and search for jobs.
